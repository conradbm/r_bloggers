<h2> R Bloggers Tutorials </h2>

<p> <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/">r-bloggers</a> is a super cool little subscriber based newsletter that I found to be
a very good way to stay sharp on my R skills alongside learning some cool new topics: </p>

<ul>
<li>New packages inside R</li>
<li>Unexplored horizons in the R language</li>
<li>New ways of doing old tricks, but in R</li>
</ul>

<p>The hope of this repository is to become a consise collection of each of the tutorials I find most helpful and with some notes
of new things I learned through the tutorial; if others find this tutorial, they may be able to capture the high points in the associated README.md
files and learn something quick &amp; easy</p>
